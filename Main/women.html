<div>This website was created in part to assist in a larger, ongoing project of tracing Henry VIII’s building
workers and their movements from house to house. The records are incomplete, but nevertheless still vast. The general pattern is that the king’s officials brought in master craftsmen from previous projects to head construction, and recruited skilled workmen from the capital and other regions as needed to staff the workshop. Unskilled labor was usually locally hired. In sites of extended building, like Hampton Court palace, the local economy was heavily impacted for years by these construction projects.
This site showcases one thread, often invisible, in this busy production scene: the women who appear on the payroll records of these house construction sites. They are far fewer than the men, and almost without exception appear in ancillary positions, as sellers of miscellaneous goods or wives of more formally established artisans employed in the building trade. Nevertheless, by highlighting these individuals, we hope to provide a glimpse into a lively and significant, if frequently overlooked, aspect that women played in the building works that flourished so strongly in Henry VIII’s England.
